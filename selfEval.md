# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel very confident with the comparison operators (===, !==, <=, >=, <, >) They are fairly straightforward and were explained well. Something that was clarified for me was which symbol should come first in a greater than/equals to situation-- that it should go based on how you normally say it. I hope that makes sense. For example we don't say equals to or greater than, we say the greater (or less) than first, so it should go first in your code.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I feel very confident with && and || as well. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I feel confident here as well.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent probably in total about an hour. My assignment is a lot later than expected becuase I went to the gitHub review, and had my pairing session earlier, and then had to run a quick errand. Overall, the lesson made sense and this lined up fairly well with my estimate, though the scheduling itself was in a much different order than it was originally. I'll need to adjust it on my calendar.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I feel pretty happy with where I am. One thing I would really like to do is reorganize some of my notes so they are easier to reference. And to make a master list of commands and shortcuts. I've been taking notes on paper and slowly reviewing by reorganizing them in Notion. Notion seems to understand some of markdown on the user side so that has been cool to see!


1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Some of the questions I had, I answered with tests in my code and found out what would happen or if something would work. If there are lingering uncertainties I can ask in small group or our mod0 larger group.
